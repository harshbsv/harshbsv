- About Me: I am a self-taught programmer. Mobile apps always fascinated me, and it has been my childhood dream to learn and build amazing mobile apps. I was in the final semester of my Masters, puzzled about my career ahead. However, one introductory cookbook later, I knew what I wanted to work on - Flutter!!
